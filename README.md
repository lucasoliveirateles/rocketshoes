The Flux (architecture) is a project made by Facebook, which together with the React Framework is used to build web applications on the client-side that work reactively. Basically a form of unidirectional flow of data between events and listeners.

In this project, I will show you how to create a simple e-commerce using Flux concepts with lib Redux.
